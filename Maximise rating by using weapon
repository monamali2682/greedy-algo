Problem Description
As we know, War has started between Russia and Ukraine.
Putin(President of Russia) has an initial power of P, a rating of 0, and a suitcase of weapons where weapon[i]
is the value of the ith weapon   (weapon[] array and P is given).
His objective is to maximize his total rating by using each weapon in one of two ways:
He may utilize the ith weapon in 2 ways -
1. if his current power is at least weapon[i], losing weapon[i] power and gaining 1 rating.
2. If he has a higher rating than 0, he can sell weapon[i], gaining weapon[i] power and losing 1 rating.
Each weapon may be used at most once and in any order.
Return the maximum possible rating that Putin can achieve after using any number of weapons. He need not use all the weapons.

public class Weapons{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(),P = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        arr[i]=sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(weapons(n,P,arr));
    }

    static int weapons(int n,int power,int weapon[]){
        int rating =0;
        Arrays.sort(weapon);
        int left=0;  // use from this end
        int right =n-1;   // sell from this end
        while(left <=right){
                if(power>=weapon[left]){ // if can use, use it
                    rating++;
                    power-= weapon[left];
                    left++;
                }else{
                    if(left==right){ // when there is only one weapon , either use it to gain rating or dont sell it because it will decrease rating and there is no need increase power
                        return rating;
                    }
                    else if(rating>=1){ // if can not use, sell it
                        rating--;
                        power+= weapon[right];
                        right--;
                    }
